The Assignment 1 was succesfully completed. 

Program the Arduino to do 5 commands
- Move Forward (Both Motors Moving Forward)
- Move Backwards (Both Motors Moving Backward)
- Move Left (Move Left Motor Backwards and Right Motor Forwards)
- Move Right (Move Right Motor Backwards and Left Motor Forwards)
